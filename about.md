## Submissions
We do not accept all submissions. We only select high quality, beautiful, and comprehensive examples of ambitious web applications built using Ember.js. We do not accept personal projects, weekend or demo projects. All submissions must follow the instructions on the *How to submit* section below. We reserve the right to reject any submission. Submissions with inappropriate content will not be accepted.

## How to submit
To submit a site suggestion, [open an issue](https://github.com/getblimp/built-with-ember/issues/new) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/GetBlimp/built-with-ember). Pull requests will be given higher priority since they are easier to include.  Make sure the screenshot is **1000×800** for desktop apps/websites and **750×1330** for mobile apps/websites and please double check that everything looks good before submitting. It's also a good idea to run the screenshot through an image optimizer like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) before including it. This will help keep the website fast and the repository small as possible.

## About the site
Inspired by [Bootstrap Expo](http://expo.getbootstrap.com/). It's built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/getblimp/built-with-ember), and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
